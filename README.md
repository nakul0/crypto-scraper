# Crypto-Scraper

# 📊 Cryptocurrency Data Scraper using Python & BeautifulSoup

# Description
This project is a web scraping tool that extracts real-time data of cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap. The script utilizes Python’s requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to collect data such as:

Cryptocurrency name
Current price
Market capitalization
24-hour trading volume
7-day price change

The data is then stored in a structured format using pandas, allowing users to save it as a CSV file for analysis, visualization, or tracking market trends.

# Features
📈 Real-time data extraction: Automatically fetches up-to-date cryptocurrency data.

💾 CSV export: Save the extracted data to a CSV file for further analysis.

🛠️ Easy to customize: Modify the script to include additional data points or enhance functionality.

🚀 Simple and efficient: Uses lightweight libraries for quick and efficient scraping.

# Technologies Used
Python
requests for sending HTTP requests
BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content
pandas for organizing data
matplotlib/seaborn (optional) for visualizing trends

# Customization
To scrape additional information (e.g., circulating supply, market rank), update the column indices in the script based on the current HTML structure.
You can also schedule the script to run periodically using cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to keep your data up to date.

# To-Do List
 Add support for dynamic content loading using Selenium.
 Create interactive data visualizations using Plotly or Dash.
 Build a simple dashboard to display cryptocurrency trends.
